# isometric candy city

1. I start by downloading a tile asset from the Unity asset store.
2. Then I import it in my project. 
3. Create the GameObject 'Grid' with with Isometic Z on Y to allow elevetions in my video game
4. Create a Tile Palette - adjust the side of the grid to the side of the sprite elements so they perfectly fit
5. Create two new folders: for bitmaps and for palettes 
6. Add all sprintes i want to use to the palette. 
7 Once I've them all, start painting the scene with the different tiles 

I've created a colorful maze as the main scene for my characters inspired by two games: pac man and candy crush 

Hope you like it
